# chart

Web-based application for creating and visualizing knitting charts.
## 2DO list
* Display and edit and save a chart
* Generate picture of what it would look like 
* Text-to-chart: take the written description (which I hate) and convert it into chart

### Technical details
* ASP.NET
* MVC
* EF 6
and all kinds of stuff I'm trying to practice
